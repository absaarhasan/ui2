My Portfolio | Angular | Node | Responsive HTML5 | CSS3 Animations | SASS | Grunt

This is the code for my portfolio. It is a single page App designed to support multiple pages, however it only really features one page at the moment!

It is a reasonable example of Angular 1. It does not feature any unit testing, but it does do it's best to be well structured, and adherent to the John Pappa style guide.
